# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/quangthao2002/Food_FS.git
   cd food-fe
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
